			A wide range of salads and snacks is also served here. After a lunch or dinner, you will be offered to try one of the desserts. The meal can be accompanied by alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails.
			Prices in this restaurant are affordable. Waiters are very attentive and can assist with the choice of the dishes. I have their loyalty card and receive 5% discount every time I go there. You can also order food online and they will deliver it to your door. The delivery is free of charge.</div>
